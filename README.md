# Grub2 Keymaps

Took me 24h to not be on outdated documentation so made a script to save time for others. 

Thanks to this blog post [FitzBlog](https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/how-to-change-the-keymap-keyboard-layout-used-by-the-grub-shell-in-gentoo-linux/)

Basically when running `grub-mklayout` to generate the layout file: I would get error: `ckbcomp` not found. So you just need to make sure to have it from the AUR (hopefully becomes a core package). 

Then follow the steps from the guide (which is the same as the script here). 

Cheers.
